Create a report that includes the following data, including a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data. 

    District Summary:
        Total number of unique schools
        Total students
        Total budget
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

    School Summary:
        School name
        School type
        Total students
        Total school budget
        Per student budget
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

    Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):    
        Schools are sorted by % overall passing in descending order, and display the top 5 rows.
        The results are saved in a DataFrame called "top_schools"

    Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing):
        Schools are sorted by % overall passing in ascending order, and display the top 5 rows.
        The results are saved in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools" 

    Math Scores by Grade
        Has a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

    Reading Scores by Grade
        Has a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

    Scores by School Spending
        Has a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
        And a DataFrame called "spending_summary"
        The following metrics are included in the table:
            Average math score
            Average reading score
            % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
            % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
            % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

    Scores by School Size
        Has a DataFrame called "size_summary" that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)

    Scores by School Type
        Has a DataFrame called "type_summary" that shows school performance based on the "School Type"
