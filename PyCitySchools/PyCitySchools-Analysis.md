City Schools Analysis

Conclusion

Based on the data provided of city schools and passing rates for math and reading, we can see that more students passed reading over math. Although, there were less students that passed both math and reading, over passing one subject over the other.  We can also conclude that the spending more money may not be the key in increasing overall performance, but that student population or type of school may.  However, without further information like student to teacher ratio, average family income, parental background, teacher quality, learning infrastructure, etc. – it is difficult to fully conclude by just budget, student population and school type alone what impacts student performance in math and reading. 

The data shows that schools with the highest overall passing rate were not the schools with the highest total budget or average spend per student.  Furthermore, when looking at the bottom 5 performing schools, the average budget and spend per student of those 5 schools were higher than the average of top 5 performing schools. Therefore, as stated before, the dollars spent on the students did not have much impact on the students’ performance.  This is emphasized when looking at the School Scores by Spending – the overall performance rate goes down as the as the spending ranges gets higher. Although, I would not go as far as saying that spending less means higher performance even though the overall passing rate seems to decline the higher the spend per student was. 

The better conclusion regarding performance is on the type of school and student population.  Charter schools, with their smaller student size, versus district schools, with their larger population performed much higher than all the district schools.  When separately calculating the average student population by school type, we get 1524 for the 8 charter schools vs. 3854 for the 7 district schools.  This conclusion further reinforced when looking at the school types for both top and bottom performers - the top 5 performing schools are charter schools vs. the bottom 5 schools, are district types.  Furthermore, the summary on School Scores by Type and School Scores by Size shows higher overall performance rate for charter schools and schools with medium to small population.
